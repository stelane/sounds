# Sounds

This is a small set of examples for my ElixirConf talk 2024. 

## Installation

This project runs on Elixir 1.17.2 and OTP 27

Install FluidSynth so MIDISynth is able to be used: 

```
brew install fluidsynth pkg-config
```

Start up your terminal 

```
iex -S mix
```

Play around with the different examples 
Spawn, Task, SimpleGS, GS, Monitor

There are two commented out files that contain the list of args to use as notes. 
notes.ex is the first two phrases of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star
chromatic_scale.ex is a multiple octave chromatic scale
